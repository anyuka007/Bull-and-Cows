Welcome to Bulls and Cows, the ultimate game of logic and deduction! Whether you're pitting your wits against a friend or challenging the computer, this game will keep you on your toes. 

Game Modes:

Player vs. Computer:
You Guess: The computer selects a secret four-digit number, with all digits unique. Your task is to guess the computer's number as efficiently as possible.
Computer's Clues: After each guess, the computer will give you feedback:
Bulls: Digits that are correct and in the right position.
Cows: Digits that are correct but in the wrong position.
Keep guessing until you correctly decipher the computer's secret number. Can you beat the machine?

Computer vs. Player:
Computer Guesses: This time, you set a secret four-digit number with unique digits. The computer will try to guess your number.
Your Clues: After each guess by the computer, you’ll need to provide feedback:
Bulls: Digits that are correct and in the right position.
Cows: Digits that are correct but in the wrong position.
Watch as the computer tries to crack your code. How many guesses will it take?

Example of Play:
Secret Number: 4271
Guess: 1234
Result: 1 Bull (the digit "2" is correct and in the right spot) and 2 Cows (the digits "4" and "1" are correct but in the wrong spots).

Winning:
In Player vs. Computer, you win by correctly guessing the computer's secret number.
In Computer vs. Player, you win if the computer can't guess your secret number in a reasonable number of tries!
Are you ready to take on the challenge? Select your mode and start cracking codes!
